 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze an online bookstore database. By writing queries of increasing complexity, the project provides insights into:

📦 Book Inventory – stock levels, most/least popular books, genre distribution

🛒 Customer Behavior – purchasing trends, top spenders, customer locations

💰 Sales & Revenue – total revenue, revenue by genre, order trends over time

The project simulates real-world business questions faced by e-commerce and retail platforms, showing how SQL can help decision-making.

🗂 Dataset

The database consists of 3 core tables:

Books

Book_ID, Title, Author, Genre, Price, Stock

Contains details about the bookstore’s inventory

Customers

Customer_ID, Name, City, Country

Stores customer information and demographics

Orders

Order_ID, Book_ID, Customer_ID, Quantity, Order_Date

Tracks customer purchases and order details
