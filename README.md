📌 Project Overview

This mini project focuses on analyzing an online bookstore database using SQL. The goal is to explore tables such as Books, Customers, and Orders to extract insights about book inventory, customer behavior, orders, and revenue. Through a series of queries (basic to advanced), the project demonstrates how SQL can be used to answer real-world business questions.

🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains three main tables:

Books → book details such as title, author, genre, price, and stock

Customers → customer details such as name, city, and country

Orders → order details such as quantity, order date, and book purchased


🎯 Learning Objectives

Understand SQL fundamentals: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT

Explore relationships using JOIN, GROUP BY, and HAVING

Apply aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN)

Solve real-world business problems like tracking sales, customer spending, and stock levels

Optimize queries for better readability and efficiency
